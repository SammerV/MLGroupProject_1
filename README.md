# MLGroupProject_1
This is a group project that I did with 2 of my partners, Cheryl Aurellia and Cynthia Anne with intentions to contribute to the health field using predictive Machine Learning model in detecting cardiovascular diseases' risk.  

Cardiovascular diseases are illnesses that affect the heart and blood vessels. They include conditions like heart attacks, high blood pressure, heart failure, and strokes. These diseases are one of the main causes of death worldwide, so understanding them is very important for preventing and treating them. 

This project uses machine learning to analyze a dataset containing patient health information. The dataset includes various features, such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking habits, and medical history. By applying machine learning, the project aims to:
1. Find patterns or connections between different health factors and the presence of cardiovascular disease.
2. Build a predictive model to help detect the risk of cardiovascular disease based on patient data.
3. Provide insights that can be used to prevent and manage these diseases.
